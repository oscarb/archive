  lyrics: "I woke up this morning. \r\nI told myself it'd be a happy day.\r\nLeft home for school, \r\nI passed some children and I watched them play\r\nI aimed for the subway, \r\nthen I gave away some of my money \r\nto the poor guy in the hood, \r\nhopefully so he could get some food\r\n\r\nThen I ran away, only to be late again. \r\nForced to prey that I would miss my train\r\nGrabbed a newspaper on the go! \r\nWill there be something new that I didn't know?\r\nAnd I read it, just like I usually do, \r\nuntil the train pulls out and it's time to move\r\n\r\nTook a walk from the station to the school, \r\nI met some friends, they were playing cool\r\nHad a chat with them, they were late for class, \r\nnot so cool anymore, they were running fast\r\n\r\nAt last, I'm at the end of the line, \r\nI'm in school and I'm right on time.\r\nThat was my day so far, \r\nplease tell me yours whoever you are!\r\n\r\n\r\nHow was your day today? \r\nWas it good, bad or just okay?\r\nMy day, it went pretty fast. \r\nToo bad I couldn't make it last.\r\nx2\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysics yo, time was going slow. \r\nSo I asked my bro' \"isn't time to go?\"\r\nBut he said \"No, but it will be over soon\". \r\nSo I checked my watch and it is afternoon \r\nAnd the sun is shining, and it's bright outside, \r\nbut no way to notice between these walls.\r\n\r\nBut hey! Schools out for today, it's time to head home.\r\nI put my clothes on and turned on my mobile phone. \r\nThen I took the subway home.\r\nWith the soundtrack to my life to play in the back, \r\nI keep my mind open while I try to stay on track.\r\n\r\nI'm searching for the girl for me. \r\nBut it feels like I'm in the wrong place to be.\r\nI've been searching for this girl for long, \r\nbut it's hard to find you (now I'm all on my own).\r\n\r\nAnd I got home and turned on my computer, \r\nlike each and every day.\r\nPut in the password and the name of my user, \r\nto check my Gmail.\r\nAnd so the day goes by, \r\nplease tell me yours, let’s give it a try!\r\n\r\n\r\nHow was your day today? \r\nWas it good, bad or just okay?\r\nMy day, it went pretty fast. \r\nToo bad I couldn't make it last.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the night arrives I think about my life, \r\nthe good, the bad, the future and the past\r\nNo matter how I try to keep my feelings aside, \r\nthose will always be there, now I'm writing these lines.\r\nAnd I close my eyes and the thoughts go deep, \r\nfrom times to times I manage to sleep.\r\nMy day is over, my mission complete. \r\nCan you feel the beat?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow was your day today? \r\nWas it good, bad or just okay?\r\nMy day, it went pretty fast. \r\nToo bad I couldn't make it last.\r\n\r\nHow was your day today? \r\nGood, bad or just okay?\r\nMy day, it went pretty fast. \r\nToo bad I couldn't make it last.\r\n\r\nHow was your Monday today? \r\nGood, bad or just okay?\r\nMy day, it went pretty fast. \r\nToo bad I couldn't make it last."

Connect to body. #\r\nFading into real, with settings getting ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's... \r\nI don't know the time, \r\nmy mind is all clear. \r\nI don't know where I am, \r\nexcept that I am here.\r\n\r\nI don't know where I'm off to, \r\nor where I started from. \r\nAll I know is that I'm making this journey all alone.\r\n\r\nBy myself, \r\nwith what started \r\nas some lyrics in my mind, \r\nbut will end as just \r\nanother in a line.\r\n\r\nBy myself, with insomnia \r\nrunning through my veins, \r\nkeeping me all day up, \r\ndriving me insane.\r\n\r\nCause wherever I am \r\nand wherever I go, \r\nit's haunting me down, \r\nlike my own shadow.\r\n\r\nThere's no pen in my hand, \r\nand no notepad in my bed, \r\nI'm starting to believe \r\nthat it's all in my head.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't remember \r\nthe last time I was asleep. \r\nam I sleeping forever \r\nor living with my mind too deep?\r\n\r\nThey say \"life goes on\", \r\nI'm not so sure about that. \r\nI've been in this condition for too long, \r\nunable to chat.\r\n\r\nThey say \"friends come and go, \r\nenemies accumulate\", \r\nI'd say my worst enemy \r\nis my own soulmate.\r\n\r\nThey say \"don't dream your life, \r\nlive your dreams\", \r\nI'd say I'm guessing \r\nI'm somewhere in between."
